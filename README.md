## Tutorial

Although it is a simple app, I want to notion a few things about application.

- First of all, for being able to use this app you have to register. It is very easy to register in this app. App only asks you about your name, e-mail for password restoring and a password for security. 

- Secondly, after logging in you can add your todos by clicking <b>Add Todo</b> section on navigation bar. You can name your task and give it a description

- Another thing is about editing your tasks. In this case you have 2 options:
    - First, <b>modify</b> -> With this option you can edit on current task. E.g if your task name is "Do laundry" and if you selected modify option, in Task section you will see "Do laundry" and in Description "whatever in description side". This option is very helpful especially if you have typos in todos.
    - Second, <b>edit</b> -> This option gives you a blank sections, you can add new task name or description or both. With this option you don't even need to delete all past task name or description.
- And finally about filtering. This app also has filtering option. In _My Todos_ section if you click on <b>Completed</b> header of table. After clicking you will see, 3 options All,✅,❌. By choosing one of them you can filter your todos.
